DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM OUTLINE
-------------------------------

Main purpose is to check the internet speed every minute and then process it and store it into a dataframe.

(DONE: Use task scheduler) Check the internet speed every 15 minute.
    - HOW TO CHECK AND HAVE DONE EVERY MIN?!
        -> A: can use task scheduler to start the script and implement in the script when to check speed
                - check speed when the min % 15 == 0 ??

Create/open a new dataframe for current today.

    - check if .csv for current year_month exists
        - if it does:
            - open the dataframe
        - else:
            - create a new dataframe with the appropriate columns for the month

    - pandas dataframe will have the following columns:
        - ping, server, download speed, upload speed, time/date (possibly keep seperate) of test, ?location?, ?can we do which wifi port?

    - set this dataframe as the current one.



    - Using speedtest to check the download speed, upload speed (not as important), server and ping.
    - process this data (convert bits/s to megabytes/s).
    - add the data to the current dataframe.

    - ??? possibly implement geolocation ???

Open the CSV file containing the previous days data as a dataframe.
    - open this data frame as past dataframe.

Save (export) the dataframe in a CSV file.
    - append the current dataframe information to the old data.
    - save the newly udpated dataframe containing all of the information.

??possilby save the CSV files by month??
    - in seperate files.

??? might need a way for program to check which months csv file should be open???
    - need a naming system.
    - will need a function to parse the current date and open the appropriate CSV files.
